    <h3>Course Overview</h3>
    <p>This course is about the creation and maintenance of a long-term strategic vision for the firm and formulating and implementing competitive strategy in accordance with that vision. This course builds on functional areas such as marketing, accounting, finance, and management. To understand how a firm can alter or develop its strategic position, we will examine contemporary business theories and issues. The goal is to provide you with the tools necessary to evaluate a firm’s external environment and resources.</p>
    <p>It should be noted, however, that there might not be a straightforward “right” answer. Managers rarely know if they have made the “right” decision. The cases we will analyze during the semester simulate this ambiguity. As such, there are multiple solutions to each case we analyze. The nature of this course requires that you integrate material you have learned in prior classes in your MBA and undergraduate programs (where applicable) with the concepts we will examine during this semester. Often we will reach consensus on some issues although in many cases we will all have differing interpretations. This is the nature of strategy and policy issues.</p>
    <p>My goal is for you to develop the skills to evaluate a given situation, evaluate the alternatives and develop a solution. Thus, much of my evaluation will be based on what you do with the information, whether the solution is logical and fits the given situation, and how you would implement your strategy. The skills that can be learned in this class are not only essential for general managers to learn, but for consultants and entry-level managers from all disciplines, especially given an increasingly competitive environment.</p>
    <p>However, this is only half of the battle so to speak. In addition to being able to develop a strategic perspective, it is imperative for you to develop and use information gathering and analytical skills, which you have learned in the MBA program. This often involves first trying to understand what is important and what the problem is. To do this, you need to be able to collect information on your own and to analyze it. In the “real world” you won’t have a neat little case to provide you all the information you need; you’ll have to figure it out on your own! Those who can deal with this ambiguity, gather important information, analyze it, diagnose problems or identify opportunities, and provide solid solutions will be invaluable to their companies.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I will mention that it is critical for you to be able to effectively communicate your ideas. Although an online course limits your ability to interact as richly as you would in a classroom, what you are able to take from the course will be directly commensurate with your interaction with peers in terms of discussion.</p>

    <h3>Course Goals and Objectives</h3>
    <p>With this in mind, this course develops the concepts and tools to help you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the nature of strategic competitiveness and develop the ability to analyze the competitive environment facing a firm, assess the attractiveness of the industry and isolate potential sources of competitive advantage and disadvantage.</li>
        <li>Integrate knowledge and apply analytical techniques from various disciplines, including finance, accounting, management, marketing, and economics. The goal is to identify and analyze strategic issues and develop solutions in the form of implementable plans with the purpose of developing and sustaining competitive advantage.</li>
        <li>Discriminate among the types of data that general managers need to evaluate alternative scenarios. Develop logical, coherent and persuasive analyses for a desired course of action. Consider how to effectively implement plans within the constraints imposed by the complex behavior of individuals within organizations.</li>
        <li>Develop the ability to view the organization as a whole and to assess it in relation to business unit goals and objectives.</li>
